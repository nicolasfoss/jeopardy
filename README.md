# Jeopardy

Jeopardy! (hosted by Alex Trebek) has cemented itself in TV history as one of the most iconic American game shows of all time. In this project, I examined ten years worth of Jeopardy! episodes with text mining techniques to find the most frequently asked types of questions on the show.

The dataset (https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/) used in this project is a cleaned subset of this dataset from the Datasets subreddit, uploaded by user trexmatt.
